* A project which has lot of scope to make improvements further in the future.

## Strategy

### User Needs.

User should access the website on all devices and should be easy enough to navigate and get all the info needed

#### Technical limitations

Current project is interactive website. There is lot of scope to improve the content and features. Should be able to improve the cake assortment section, and cake selection section for 
easy interaction. The project is open to arrange payment section. The website can be built to give confirmation to user after order, through sms and email.

Current project uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery. Libraries like Bootstrap, EmailJS, Google maps API are used.


## Scope

To encourage user to make an order for cake. To develop a curiosity in user to bring back to the website.  It is important to get all social media links function properly 
and to reach wider audience, everything should be smoother and simpler. To give out the clear information needed

## Structure

With a carousel slides, the cake images with intriguing captions, should attract the user to make an order for the cake.
The Home page should give out the types of cake available with some user reviews. The header page should have a logo and funky fonts for the navigation menu. 
Small screens should have toggler menu. The footer page should make links for social media. Give some information about 
the enterpreneur, and also contact to reach in case there are any queries.

The Order page should help the user to pick a cake, and understand which cake is ordered through a text. 
Then the user should be advised to  fill a form . User should be clearly aware that he/she will be contacted for further discussion after the order is made.
The page should show the maps for locations, where the general delivery will be done in certain times. User should be aware of the hoome delivery costs.

Prices page should provide the information on costs of the cake. Also, User should be encouraged to subscribe for the future offers, and recipes, there by
encouraging user to visit the website back. User should be encouraged to make connection with the social media.

Feedback page should encourage the user to fill the questionaire one by one and should facilitate he/she to give a star rating.
confirmation should be must for the user to understand after the feedback is done.

# Testing

### Planning

Plan is to test the site manually and using the Google Lighthouse to evaluate the overall performance and chrome devtools to test each layout.

Devices tested for responsive design are iphone5/SE, iphone6/7/8/plus, Ipad, ipadpro, Galaxy S5

Screen testing done for the screens 24" computer screen (1920 x 1080), Laptop 14".

The entire code is checked in validators and errors identified are solved and explained in bugs section

Browsers tested are Microsoft Edge, and Google Chrome.

All user stories are considered and testing is done as per the need.

### Implementation

Plan is to test the site based on user stories. If the user stories are working as per the intention on all devices , then the testing is 
successful. Identified challenges and bugs while writing the code and how this is solved is writtten in bugs section.

I tested if i can navigate to all required pages to fulfill the user story on all devices using devtools.

I tested if i can able to call and email through the website as per user story. Preview [here](https://github.com/murthy1811/Milestone-project-1/blob/master/assets/images/snapshots/reach-to-authorities.JPG). 

I tested if the information regarding the vaccine is visible and readable to the user on all devices Preview [here](https://github.com/murthy1811/Milestone-project-1/blob/master/assets/images/snapshots/information-on-vaccine.JPG).

I made sure on registration page, a simple query is asked if an user is registering for himself or someone else. and is seen in all devices. Preview [here](https://github.com/murthy1811/Milestone-project-1/blob/master/assets/images/snapshots/register-snap.JPG).

I made sure the information regarding when one can get vaccinated on home page as well as on registration page, which is basically information
 that authorities will reach the user soon after registration.

I made sure all the links regarding the latest news are working on all devices and are opening in new tabs.

I tested all social media links are working on all devices.

I used devtools many times to test the intention, and if it does not work out, I tried to adjust the code in devtools and achieved the 
intended result by copying the changed code to the html files.

I used Lighthouse to check if the best practices are used or not. Initially I am not sure how to improve the results but tried to 
use google and made changes in the code to achieve the better results.

### Results 

There were troubles intially to make the navbar toggler icon work in mobiles. I slowly studied the navbar classes functioning in Bootstrap
and override the classes and adjusted to my requirments and achieved the intended results. Again, many times devtools are a great help.

Noticed several errors of sizing fonts to the responsive design and fixed them by writing responsive design in CSS

Intial score of the site from google light house is as below

Performance : 84% , Accesibility : 93%, Best practices :87% SEO: 90%  Initial score preview [here](https://github.com/murthy1811/Milestone-project-1/blob/master/assets/images/snapshots/Intial%20light%20house%20score.PNG).

Final score after optimization like resizing images, adding rel=noopener attribute to the a tags with target=_blank, and also added meta description

Performance : 89% , Accesibility : 93%, Best practices :93% SEO: 100% . Final score preview [here](https://github.com/murthy1811/Milestone-project-1/blob/master/assets/images/snapshots/Final%20light%20house%20score.PNG).

## Bugs

1. First hurdle in developing this site came to me to fit in the logo of vastra gotaland. The image is unable to adjust to the responsive design
   for different devices. Rather than writing more code in html, I choose to take the logo as background and adjust for different screens using
   bootstrap and called media queries for different screen sizes

2. Further, this gave me trouble in while coding for toggler icon for mobiles. The toggler icon  while expanding, the menu items were floating to 
   right and overflowed out of screen. By writing the correct code for bootstrap for navbar and adjusting classes I managed to solve this.
   I used more classes like mr-auto, mr-2 and navbar-collapse class width is adjusted to suit the needs.

3. I noticed after coding, that Home menu is not visible on ipad. Then I wrote the media screen query (max-width: 992px) and (min-width: 768px)  for different screens, which involved
   ipad as well. This solved the issue.

4. Initially I want to the expanded menu on mobiles to occupy the space above hero image. I could not solve this first. Later, I managed to solve
    using stackoverflow.com website help by using fixed-top command in html but I noticed that instead of menu occupying above the image, it is clean to push the content down.
    So, later I kept the original code.

5. Images in info section of the index page, were distorted initially. During the mentor mid project review, a quick suggestion by mentor 
   solved this. I used object-fit in CSS to solve this.

6. Register button in Info section of index page initially do not have the link to open the register page. With a little search and help from
   w3schools.com , I updated the code and solved this. onclick="document.location='register.html' is added to the button element
   
7. Initially Logo is not linked to index page. A little check upon my code myself and adjusting the divs , and bootstrap classes solved this.

8. When Nav links highlighitng not worked, I noticed class active is missing and corrected in all pages as needed.

9. Register page is not properly aligned in mobile. As per mentor recommendation, I corrected the code by making a single form and keeping all labels
   and inputs in one form, and wrote the proper CSS code, alignment is achieved in mobile for registration.

10. Added telephone and email links in contact page by href=tel and href=mailto: options as per mentor recommendation

11. In location section, for index and contact pages, intially I used only h4 and h5 elements , and as per mentor recommendation , I changed it to h4 and properly

12. While code is checked in validators, there is an parse error and the same code is written again and deleted the old one. This solved the issue

13. Wrong usage of p element is identified when ul element is placed with in p. This error is fixed.
