Deviations from the wireframes

  - On the home page, It is decided to change the pattern of the images , add buttons to showcase the assortment with some javascript.
  otherwise, not much changes are made from wireframes.


- ### Design

  - #### Colour Scheme

   I took help from  https://coolors.co/palettes/trending to decide to color palettes
  I decided to go for a little funky and bold colors , as it should invoke the feeling of fun and party in user. I choose #bc6c25 , a layer of brown, for the main text and content.
  I kept buttons with basic white text and a background of #17a2b8. I chose footer to be with black background with text in rgb(241, 176, 129), so as to show clear deviation from the 
  main page 

  - #### Typography

    [Reggae One](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Merienda&family=Reggae+One&display=swap) was chosen as the main font for this website with sans-serif as the fallback font.
    Reggae One is little funky to appeal to the fun aspect of an user. Another funky and stylish font Merienda is used to distinguish soome text from others.

### Using your own Google maps API key

Since the API key is restricted to work only the url's I added in my account, google maps function will not work. 
    You should create your own account in google cloud platform and get the key for maps API. check out the site for instructions [here] (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/maps-static/get-api-key)

Go to the order.html, go to the end of the code. Just before the body closing, look for script tag with maps.googleapis.com, and replace the existing key with your own.


### Using your own EmailJS

Create your own account in emailJS. Make sure you have the email service for example a, free service like gmail. 
Create a template with the variables needed, shown in the javascript "from_name","from_phone","cake","message","message2","address","reply_to" .
Get your own template id, and service id. Copy it in the below javascript line in order.js
emailjs.send("service_xkqr1dk", "template_m0virhs")
